# Muckrock Document Cloud Addons - CS519 Spring 2022

# Links to Repositories

As our project involves making multiple GitHub Repositories that function as GitHub Actions for use as add-ons to the DocumentCloud functionality, 
we can't really have all of our code in this repository. As such, we will link to all of our individual repositories here:

Have been tested and deployed on our end as working GitHub Actions:

- Metadata Scraper: https://github.com/cam-garrison/documentcloud-metadata-grabber
- User uploads over time graphing: https://github.com/cam-garrison/doccloud-uploads-graph
- Find and link legal citations within documents: https://github.com/JamesKunstle/documentcloud-legal-citation-identifcation-addon 
- Regex Pattern Bank Addon for finding PII: https://github.com/JamesKunstle/documentcloud-multi-regex-pattern-bank-addon
- Multi Regex Addon: https://github.com/JamesKunstle/documentcloud-multi-regex-addon 
- Average Document Page Count: https://github.com/sooryu22/documentcloud-avg-page-count-addon
- Custom Metadata Scraper: https://github.com/EliteEagle77/documentcloud-custom-metadata-scraper-addon
- Redact Bottom Inch: https://github.com/EliteEagle77/documentcloud-redact-bottom-inch-addon
- Identify Bad Redactions: https://github.com/sooryu22/documentcloud-bad-redactions-addon

Works in progress, not yet run as GitHub Actions:
